      A Domain Name Server (DNS) amplification attack is a popular form of

      accessible open DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response
      traffic.
    </p>
    
<p>
      A Domain Name Server (DNS) Amplification attack is a popular form of
      Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), in which attackers use publically
      accessible open DNS servers to flood a target system with DNS response traffic.
      The primary technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request
      to an open DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the target&#39;s
      address. When the DNS server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead
      to the target. Attackers will typically submit a request for as much zone
      information as possible to maximize the amplification effect. In most attacks
      of this type observed by US-CERT, the spoofed queries sent by the attacker are
      of the type, &quot;ANY&quot; which returns all known information about a DNS zone in a
      single request. Because the size of the response is considerably larger than
      the request, the attacker is able to increase the amount of traffic directed at
      the victim. By leveraging a botnet to produce a large number of spoofed DNS
      queries, an attacker can create an immense amount of traffic with little
      effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from
      valid servers, it is extremely difficult to prevent these types of attacks.
      While the attacks are difficult to stop, network operators can apply several
      possible mitigation strategies.
    </p>
    
<p>
      While the most common form of this attack that US-CERT has observed
      involves DNS servers configured to allow unrestricted recursive resolution for
      any client on the Internet, attacks can also involve authoritative name servers
      that do not provide recursive resolution. The attack method is similar to open
      recursive resolvers, but is more difficult to mitigate since even a server
      configured with best practices can still be used in an attack. In the case of
      authoritative servers, mitigation should focus on using Response Rate Limiting
      to restrict the amount of traffic.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to memory corruption. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. 
    </p>
    
<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.

<p>
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation.
