<p>
      A Domain Name Server (DNS) amplification attack is a popular form of

      accessible open DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response
      traffic.
    </p>
    
<p>
      A Domain Name Server (DNS) Amplification attack is a popular form of
      Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), in which attackers use publically
      accessible open DNS servers to flood a target system with DNS response traffic.
      The primary technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request
      to an open DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the target&#39;s
      address. When the DNS server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead
      to the target. Attackers will typically submit a request for as much zone
      information as possible to maximize the amplification effect. In most attacks
      of this type observed by US-CERT, the spoofed queries sent by the attacker are
      of the type, &quot;ANY&quot; which returns all known information about a DNS zone in a
      single request. Because the size of the response is considerably larger than
      the request, the attacker is able to increase the amount of traffic directed at
      the victim. By leveraging a botnet to produce a large number of spoofed DNS
      queries, an attacker can create an immense amount of traffic with little
      effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from
      valid servers, it is extremely difficult to prevent these types of attacks.
      While the attacks are difficult to stop, network operators can apply several
      possible mitigation strategies.
    </p>
    
<p>
      While the most common form of this attack that US-CERT has observed
      involves DNS servers configured to allow unrestricted recursive resolution for
      any client on the Internet, attacks can also involve authoritative name servers
      that do not provide recursive resolution. The attack method is similar to open
      recursive resolvers, but is more difficult to mitigate since even a server
      configured with best practices can still be used in an attack. In the case of
      authoritative servers, mitigation should focus on using Response Rate Limiting
      to restrict the amount of traffic.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to memory corruption. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.

Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

A denial of service vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to a scan timeout. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could prevent the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine from monitoring affected systems until the service is restarted.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to open the document file.

<p>By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit.

<p>Microsoft has deprecated the Document Signing functionality in XPS Viewer. This functionality relied upon the SHA-1 algorithm and is part of our overall effort to remove this algorithm from our products. This change impacts XPS Viewer on all supported versions of Windows.
FAQ
1. I need to use this deprecated functionality. Is there a way to enable it?
Yes. Please create the following registry entry:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\XPSViewer] &quot;EnableDigitalSignatures&quot;=dword:00000001
2. What risks am I accepting by using SHA-1 based document signing?
SHA-1 is a legacy cryptographic hash that many in the security community believe is no longer secure. Using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm in document signing could allow an attacker to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or otherwise manipulate content of a document. Microsoft, in collaboration with other members of the industry, is working to phase out the SHA-1 algorithm and to warn consumers of the possible risk when they encounter websites using the SHA-1 algorithm.

        Microsoft is aware of a new publicly disclosed class of vulnerabilities referred to as &#39;speculative execution side-channel attacks&#39; that affect many modern processors and operating systems including Intel, AMD, and ARM. Note: this issue will affect other systems such as Android, Chrome, iOS, MacOS, so we advise customers to seek out guidance from those vendors.

        An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities.

        Microsoft has released updates to help mitigate these vulnerabilities. To get all available protections, firmware (microcode) and software updates are required. This may include microcode from device OEMs and in some cases updates to AV software as well. In some cases, installing these updates will have a performance impact. We have also taken action to secure our cloud services.

        Microsoft has no information to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been used to attack customers at this time. Microsoft continues working closely with industry partners including chip makers, hardware OEMs, and app vendors to protect customers.

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. 
    </p>
    
<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.
    </p>
    
<p>
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

<p>Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member &quot;the_request&quot;, while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the &#39;:&#39; delimiter of any request header lines. RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the &#39;:&#39; character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace. These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A&#39; by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A&#39; as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A&#39; content to a different downstream user-agent. These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later. By toggling from &#39;Strict&#39; behavior to &#39;Unsafe&#39; behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to &#39;Unsafe&#39; will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.</p>

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to memory corruption. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.
    </p>
    
<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

      Legacy block ciphers having a block size of 64 bits are vulnerable to a practical collision attack when used in CBC
      mode. The security of a block cipher is often reduced to the key size k: the best attack should
      be the exhaustive search of the key, with complexity 2 to the power of k. However, the block size n is also an
      important security parameter, defining the amount of data that can be encrypted under the same key. This is
      particularly important when using common modes of operation: we require block ciphers to be secure with up to 2 to
      the power of n queries, but most modes of operation (e.g. CBC, CTR, GCM, OCB, etc.) are unsafe with more than 2
      to the power of half n blocks of message (the birthday bound). With a modern block cipher with 128-bit blocks such

      bound corresponds to only 32 GB, which is easily reached in practice. Once a collision between two cipher blocks

<p>ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0k (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0j).</p>

      Legacy block ciphers having a block size of 64 bits are vulnerable to a practical collision attack when used in CBC
      mode. All versions of the SSL/TLS protocols that support cipher suites which use 3DES as the symmetric encryption
      cipher are affected. The security of a block cipher is often reduced to the key size k: the best attack should
      be the exhaustive search of the key, with complexity 2 to the power of k. However, the block size n is also an
      important security parameter, defining the amount of data that can be encrypted under the same key. This is
      particularly important when using common modes of operation: we require block ciphers to be secure with up to 2 to
      the power of n queries, but most modes of operation (e.g. CBC, CTR, GCM, OCB, etc.) are unsafe with more than 2

A denial of service vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to a scan timeout. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could prevent the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine from monitoring affected systems until the service is restarted.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploits exploited this vulnerability would gain code execution on the target system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the document file.

A denial of service vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to a scan timeout. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could prevent the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine from monitoring affected systems until the service is restarted.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited.

<p>Executive Summary
Microsoft is aware of the Bluetooth BR/EDR (basic rate/enhanced data rate, known as &quot;Bluetooth Classic&quot;) key negotiation vulnerability that exists at the hardware specification level of any BR/EDR Bluetooth device. An attacker could potentially be able to negotiate the offered key length down to 1 byte of entropy, from a maximum of 16 bytes.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need specialized hardware and would be limited by the range of the Bluetooth devices in use. Using this specialized equipment, they would need to be close enough to communicate and interfere with the legitimate transmissions being made wirelessly.
CERT/CC has issued CVE-2019-9506 and VU#918987 for this tampering vulnerability, which has a CVSS score of 9.3.
To address the vulnerability Microsoft has released a software update that enforces a default 7-octet minimum key length to ensure that the key negotiation does not trivialize the encryption. This functionality is disabled by default when the update is installed. Customers must enable this functionality by setting a specific flag in the registry. When the flag is set, Windows software will read the encryption key size and reject the Bluetooth connection if it does not meet the defined minimum key size.
If your particular Bluetooth device or the Bluetooth radio in your Windows device, or the driver for that Bluetooth radio does not support the longer key length, this update could block connections with that device when the registry key EnableMinimumEncryptionKeySize is set to a value of 1. Users who have issues connecting their Bluetooth devices after installing and enabling this functionality should check to see if their manufacturer is providing additional guidance on updates and mitigations.
To enable this enforcement feature by using Registry Editor, follow these steps:
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys and Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Hardware\Bluetooth
On the Edit menu, click Modify to modify the EnableMinimumEncryptionKeySize registry entry.
In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK. This sets the &quot;EnableMinimumEncryptionKeySize&quot;=dword value to 00000001
Exit Registry Editor.
Restart the computer.

You then need to reset your Bluetooth device as follows:

On the device, go to the Bluetooth Settings.
Turn off Bluetooth.
Open the Device Manager and locate the Bluetooth Controller.
Right-click on the Bluetooth Controller and select Disable device.
After the device is disabled, right-click again and select Enable device.

Computers with incompatible Bluetooth controllers or devices may have to temporarily or permanently set EnableMinimumEncryptionKeySize = 0 until controllers, firmware or drivers can be updated or the device itself updated. Bluetooth connections on computers in this state will not be secure.
To disable this enforcement feature:

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Hardware\Bluetooth
On the Edit menu, click Modify to modify the EnableMinimumEncryptionKeySize registry entry.
In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK. This sets the &quot;EnableMinimumEncryptionKeySize&quot;=dword value to 00000000
Exit Registry Editor.
Restart the computer.

You then need to follow the preceeding instructions for resetting your Bluetooth device.
Recommended Actions
The best protection is to keep computers up to date. Please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4514157 for guidance on protecting Windows devices.
If your particular device does not support the longer key length, this update could block connections with that device. Users who have issues connecting their Bluetooth devices after installing and enabling this functionality should check to see if their manufacturer is providing additional guidance on updates and mitigations.
FAQ
1. Why is this enforcement not enabled by default?
A number of devices may not currently be able to support a longer key length and would not function with this fix enabled. Combined with the difficulty to use this attack and the need of specialized equipment and proximity to the target, this was decided to be left disabled initially to avoid any compatibility issues. The choice to enable this functionality would be left up to the user.
2. Where can I find more information about enabling this functionality?
If you determine that you need to enable this functionality to enforce a default 7-octet minimum key length, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4514157.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to open the document file.

A denial of service vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to a scan timeout. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could prevent the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine from monitoring affected systems until the service is restarted.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.

Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

<p>The subject common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate does not match
the name of the entity presenting the certificate.</p>


<p>Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the
identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA&#39;s
Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation
procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual
name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate
presented by &quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;, the CN should be &quot;www.example.com&quot;.
</p>


<p>In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of
a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a
man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of
particular importance is the validity of the subject&#39;s CN, that should match
the name of the entity (hostname).</p>


<p>A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can
also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted. </p>


<p>Please note that this check may flag a false positive against servers
 that are properly configured using SNI.</p>

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to memory corruption. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.
    </p>
    
<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

<p>OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be &#39;/usr/local&#39;. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of &#39;C:/usr/local&#39;, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL&#39;s default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, &#39;/usr/local/ssl&#39; is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems connected directly to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.</p>

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to open the document file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.

        Microsoft is aware of a new publicly disclosed class of vulnerabilities referred to as &#39;speculative execution side-channel attacks&#39; that affect many modern processors and operating systems including Intel, AMD, and ARM. Note: this issue will affect other systems such as Android, Chrome, iOS, MacOS, so we advise customers to seek out guidance from those vendors.

        An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities.

        Microsoft has released updates to help mitigate these vulnerabilities. To get all available protections, firmware (microcode) and software updates are required. This may include microcode from device OEMs and in some cases updates to AV software as well. In some cases, installing these updates will have a performance impact. We have also taken action to secure our cloud services.

        Microsoft has no information to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been used to attack customers at this time. Microsoft continues working closely with industry partners including chip makers, hardware OEMs, and app vendors to protect customers.

        Please review Microsoft Security Advisory ADV180002 for more details.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to the way Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to open the document file.

A denial of service vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to a scan timeout. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could prevent the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine from monitoring affected systems until the service is restarted.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk.

<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.
    </p>
    
<p>
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to memory corruption. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. 
    </p>
    
<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    </p>
    
<p>
To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim&#39;s system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.
    </p>
    
<p>
If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. 
    </p>
    
<p>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files.
    </p>
    
<p>
Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration.
